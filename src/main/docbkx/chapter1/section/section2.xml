        <title>Single Date Response2222222</title>
        <para>
            <emphasis>22222The below sample is the response provided by the supplier system for a single date
                availability request. In this response the option (9am) of the tour (BON_PRI) is available on
                October 31 2014. The response provides a reference number (optional) for the availability hold
                that was requested in the call (see availability request sample), the reference will be used in
                the subsequent booking request (optional). The availability response also provides availability
                information for all age bands for the date and product of the request - allowing Viator systems
                to track availability for other age bands and reduce the number of calls to the supplier.
